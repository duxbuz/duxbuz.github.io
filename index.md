# ✏️ duxbuz — Art Portfolio

Welcome to my online gallery. I focus on **draughtsmanship-driven art** — from comic book illustration and digital painting to gouache portraits and landscapes.

I run a drawing club for junior artists and pass on my knowledge to the future artistic community.

## 🎨 Mediums I Work In

- **Comic Book Art** — pencils, inks, and digital 
- **Portraiture** — gouache, charcoal, and digital
- **Environments** — acrylic, gouache, and digital
- **Digital Illustration** — using Procreate, Photoshop, and Clip Studio Paint

## 🖼️ Selected Works

- **"The Watcher"** — gouache portrait on toned paper
- **"Ghost town"** — comic panel sequence penciled and inked traditionally 
- **"Echo"** — character concept for a sci-fi RPG
- **"Study of Light"** — digital portrait with layered brushwork
